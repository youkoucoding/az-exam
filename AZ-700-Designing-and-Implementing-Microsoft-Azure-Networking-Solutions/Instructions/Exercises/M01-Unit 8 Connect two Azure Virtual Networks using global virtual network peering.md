# M01-Unit 8 Connect two Azure Virtual Networks using global virtual network peering

## Exercise scenario 
In this unit, you will configure connectivity between the CoreServicesVnet and the ManufacturingVnet by adding peerings to allow traffic flow. 

In this unit, you will:

+ Task 1: Create a Virtual Machine to test the configuration
+ Task 2: Connect to the Test VMs using RDP
+ Task 3: Test the connection between the VMs
+ Task 4: Create VNet peerings between CoreServicesVnet and ManufacturingVnet
+ Task 5: Test the connection between the VMs
+ Task 6: Clean up resources

#### Estimated time: 20 minutes

## Task 1: Create a Virtual Machine to test the configuration

In this section, you will create a test VM on the Manufacturing VNet to test if you can access resources inside another Azure virtual network from your ManufacturingVnet.

### Create ManufacturingVM

1. In the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

2. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the Upload/Download files icon, in the drop-down menu, select Upload and upload the following files **ManufacturingVMazuredeploy.json** and **ManufacturingVMazuredeploy.parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory one by one from the source folder **F:\Allfiles\Exercises\M01**.

3. Deploy the following ARM templates to create the VMs needed for this exercise:

   ```powershell
   $RGName = "ContosoResourceGroup"
   
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $RGName -TemplateFile ManufacturingVMazuredeploy.json -TemplateParameterFile ManufacturingVMazuredeploy.parameters.json
   ```
  
4. When the deployment is complete, go to the Azure portal home page, and then select **Virtual Machines**.

5. Verify that the virtual machine has been created.

## Task 2: Connect to the Test VMs using RDP

1. On the Azure Portal home page, select **Virtual Machines**.

2. Select **ManufacturingVM**.

3. In ManufacturingVM, select **Connect &gt; RDP**.

4. In ManufacturingVM | Connect, select **Download RDP file**.

5. Save the RDP file to your desktop.

6. Connect to ManufacturingVM using the RDP file, and the username **TestUser** and the password **TestPa$$w0rd!**.

7. On the Azure Portal home page, select **Virtual Machines**.

8. Select **TestVM1**.

9. In TestVM1, select **Connect &gt; RDP**.

10. In TestVM1 | Connect, select **Download RDP file**.

11. Save the RDP file to your desktop.

12. Connect to TestVM1 using the RDP file, and the username **TestUser** and the password **TestPa$$w0rd!**.

13. On both VMs, in **Choose privacy settings for your device**, select **Accept**.

14. On both VMs, in **Networks**, select **Yes**.

15. On TestVM1, open a PowerShell prompt, and run the following command: ipconfig

16. Note the IPv4 address. 

 

## Task 3: Test the connection between the VMs

1. On the ManufacturingVM, open a PowerShell prompt.

2. Use the following command to verify that there is no connection to TestVM1 on CoreServicesVnet. Be sure to use the IPv4 address for TestVM1.

   ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389
    ```


3. The test connection should fail, and you will see a result similar to the following:
   ![PowerShell window with Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389 showing failed ](../media/test-netconnection-fail.png)

 

## Task 4: Create VNet peerings between CoreServicesVnet and ManufacturingVnet

1. On the Azure home page, select **Virtual Networks**, and then select **CoreServicesVnet**.

2. In CoreServicesVnet, under **Settings**, select **Peerings**.

3. On CoreServicesVnet | Peerings, select **+ Add**.

4. Use the information in the following table to create the peering.

 >**Note**: If you don't have a "MOC Subscription", use the subscription you've been using previously. It's just a name.

5. In CoreServicesVnet | Peerings, verify that the **CoreServicesVnet-to-ManufacturingVnet** peering is listed.

6. Under Virtual networks, select **ManufacturingVnet**, and verify the **ManufacturingVnet-to-CoreServicesVnet** peering is listed.

 

## Task 5: Test the connection between the VMs

1. On the ManufacturingVM, open a PowerShell prompt.

2. Use the following command to verify that there is now a connection to TestVM1 on CoreServicesVnet. 

   ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389
    ```


3. The test connection should succeed, and you will see a result similar to the following:
   ![Powershell window with Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389 showing TCP test succeeded: true](../media/test-connection-succeeded.png)

 

Congratulations! You have successful configured connectivity between VNets by adding peerings. 

## Task 6: Clean up resources

   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane. (Create Cloud Shell storage if needed, using default settings.)

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'ContosoResourceGroup' -Force -AsJob
   ```

    >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

# M05-Unit 4 Deploy Azure Application Gateway
 

In this exercise, you use the Azure portal to create an application gateway. Then you test it to make sure it works correctly.

#### Estimated time: 25 minutes

The application gateway directs application web traffic to specific resources in a backend pool. You assign listeners to ports, create rules, and add resources to a backend pool. For the sake of simplicity, this article uses a simple setup with a public front-end IP, a basic listener to host a single site on the application gateway, a basic request routing rule, and two virtual machines in the backend pool.

For Azure to communicate between the resources that you create, it needs a virtual network. You can either create a new virtual network or use an existing one. In this example, you'll create a new virtual network while you create the application gateway. Application Gateway instances are created in separate subnets. You create two subnets in this example: one for the application gateway, and another for the backend servers.

In this exercise, you will:

+ Task 1: Create an application gateway
+ Task 2: Create virtual machines
+ Task 3: Add backend servers to backend pool
+ Task 4: Test the application gateway


## Task 1: Create an application gateway

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with your Azure account.

2. On any Azure Portal page, in **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)**, enter application gateway, and then select **Application gateways** from the results.

6. Select **OK** to return to the Create application gateway Basics tab.

7. Accept the default values for the other settings and then select **Next: Frontends**.

8. On the **Frontends** tab, verify **Frontend IP address type** is set to **Public**.

9. Select **Add new** for the **Public IP address** and enter AGPublicIPAddress for the public IP address name, and then select **OK**.

10. Select **Next: Backends**.

11. On the **Backends** tab, select **Add a backend pool**.

12. In the **Add a backend pool** window that opens, enter the following values to create an empty backend pool:

    | **Setting**                      | **Value**   |
    | -------------------------------- | ----------- |
    | Name                             | BackendPool |
    | Add backend pool without targets | Yes         |

13. In the **Add a backend pool** window, select **Add** to save the backend pool configuration and return to the **Backends** tab.

14. On the **Backends** tab, select **Next: Configuration**.

15. On the **Configuration** tab, you'll connect the frontend and backend pool you created using a routing rule.

16. In the **Routing rules** column, select **Add a routing rule**.

17. In the **Rule name** box, enter **RoutingRule**.

18. On the **Listener** tab, enter or select the following information:

    | **Setting**   | **Value**         |
    | ------------- | ----------------- |
    | Listener name | Listener          |
    | Priority      | **100**           |
    | Frontend IP   | Select **Public** |

19. Accept the default values for the other settings on the **Listener** tab.

    ![Azure Portal add an Application Gateway routing rule](../media/Routing-rule-listener-tab.png)

20. Select the **Backend targets** tab to configure the rest of the routing rule.

21. On the **Backend targets** tab, enter or select the following information:

    | **Setting**      | **Value**      |
    | -------------    | -------------- |
    | Target type      | Backend pool   |
    | Backend Settings | **Add new** |

25. Select **Next: Tags** and then **Next: Review + create**.

26. Review the settings on the **Review + create** tab

27. Select **Create** to create the virtual network, the public IP address, and the application gateway. 

It may take several minutes for Azure to create the application gateway. Wait until the deployment finishes successfully before moving on to the next section.

## Task 2: Create virtual machines

1. In the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

2. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the Upload/Download files icon, in the drop-down menu, select Upload and upload the following files **backend.json** and **backend.parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory one by one from the source folder **F:\Allfiles\Exercises\M05**.

3. Deploy the following ARM templates to create the VMs needed for this exercise:

   ```powershell
   $RGName = "ContosoResourceGroup"
   
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $RGName -TemplateFile backend.json -TemplateParameterFile backend.parameters.json
   ```
  
4. When the deployment is complete, go to the Azure portal home page, and then select **Virtual Machines**.

5. Verify that both virtual machines have been created.

## Task 3: Add backend servers to backend pool

1. On the Azure portal menu, select **All resources** or search for and select All resources. Then select **ContosoAppGateway**.

2. Under **Settings**, select **Backend pools**.

3. Select **BackendPool**.

4. On the Edit backend pool page, under **Backend targets**, in **Target type**, select **Virtual machine**.

5. Under **Target**, select **BackendVM1.** 

6. In **Target type**, select **Virtual machine**.

7. Under **Target**, select **BackendVM2.** 

   ![Azure Portal add target backends to backend pool](../media/edit-backend-pool.png)

8. Select **Save**.

Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding to the next step.

## Task 4: Test the application gateway

Although IIS isn't required to create the application gateway, you installed it in this exercise to verify if Azure successfully created the application gateway.

### Use IIS to test the application gateway:

1. Find the public IP address for the application gateway on its **Overview** page. 

   ![Azure Portal look up Frontend Public IP address ](../media/app-gw-public-ip.png)

2. Copy the public IP address, and then paste it into the address bar of your browser to browse that IP address.

3. Check the response. A valid response verifies that the application gateway was successfully created and can successfully connect with the backend.

   ![Broswer - display BackendVM1 or BackendVM2 depending which backend server reponds to request.](../media/browse-to-backend.png)

4. Refresh the browser multiple times and you should see connections to both BackendVM1 and BackendVM2.

Congratulations! You have configured and tested an Azure Application Gateway.

# M06-Unit 9 Secure your virtual hub using Azure Firewall Manager

In this exercise, you will create the spoke virtual network and create a secured virtual hub, then you will connect the hub and spoke virtual networks and route traffic to your hub. Next you will deploy the workload servers, then create a firewall policy and secure your hub, and finally you will test the firewall.

## Create a hub and spoke architecture

In this part of the exercise, you will create the spoke virtual networks and subnets where you will place the workload servers. Then you will create the secured virtual hub and connect the hub and spoke virtual networks.

In this exercise, you will:

+ Task 1: Create two spoke virtual networks and subnets
+ Task 2: Create the secured virtual hub
+ Task 3: Connect the hub and spoke virtual networks
+ Task 4: Deploy the servers
+ Task 5: Create a firewall policy and secure your hub
+ Task 6: Associate the firewall policy
+ Task 7: Route traffic to your hub
+ Task 8: Test the application rule
+ Task 9: Test the network rule
+ Task 10: Clean up resources

#### Estimated time: 35 minutes

6. Click **Add**.
7. When the policy has been attached, click **Refresh**. The association should be displayed.

![Show associated firewall policy on hub](../media/associate-firewall-policy-with-hub-end.png)

 

## Task 7: Route traffic to your hub

In this task you will ensure that network traffic gets routed through your firewall.

1. In **Firewall Manager**, click **Virtual hubs**.
2. Click **Hub-01**.
3. Under **Settings**, click **Security configuration**.
4. In **Internet traffic**, select **Azure Firewall**.
5. In **Private traffic**, select **Send via Azure Firewall**.
6. Click **Save**. 
7. This will take a few minutes to complete.
8. Once configuration has completed, ensure that under **INTERNET TRAFFIC** and **PRIVATE TRAFFIC**, it says **Secured by Azure Firewall** for both hub-spoke connections.


## Task 8: Test the application rule

In this part of the exercise, you will connect a remote desktop to the firewall public IP address, which is NATed to Srv-Workload-01. You will then use a web browser to test the application rule and connect a remote desktop to Srv-Workload-02 to test the network rule.

In this task you will test the application rule to confirm that it works as expected.

1. Open **Remote Desktop Connection** on your PC.

2. In the **Computer** box, enter the **firewall's public IP address** (e.g., **51.143.226.18**).

3. Click **Show Options**.

4. In the **Username** box, enter **TestUser**.

5. Click **Connect**.

   ![RDP connection to srv-workload-01](../media/rdp-srv-workload-01.png)

6. In the **Enter your credentials** dialog box, log into the **Srv-workload-01** server virtual machine, by using the password, **TestPa$$w0rd!**.

7. Click **OK**.

8. Click **Yes** on the certificate message.

9. Open Internet Explorer and click **OK** in the **Set up Internet Explorer 11** dialog box.

10. Browse to **https://** **www.microsoft.com**.

11. In the **Security Alert** dialog box, click **OK**.

12. Click **Close** on the Internet Explorer security alerts that may pop-up.

13. You should see the Microsoft home page.

    ![RDP session browsing microsoft.com](../media/microsoft-home-page.png)

14. Browse to **https://** **www.google.com**.

15. You should be blocked by the firewall.

    ![RDP session browser blocked on google.com](../media/google-home-page-fail.png)

16. So, you have verified that you can connect to the one allowed FQDN but are blocked from all others.

## Task 9: Test the network rule

In this task you will test the network rule to confirm that it works as expected.

1. While still logged in to the **Srv-workload-01** RDP session, from this remote computer, open **Remote Desktop Connection**.

2. In the **Computer** box, enter the **private IP address** of **Srv-workload-02** (e.g., **10.1.1.4**).

3. In the **Enter your credentials** dialog box, log in to the **Srv-workload-02** server by using the username **TestUser**, and a password of **TestPa$$w0rd!**.

4. Click **OK**.

5. Click **Yes** on the certificate message.

   ![RDP session from srv-workload-01 to another RDP session on srv-workload-02](../media/rdp-srv-workload-02-from-srv-workload-01.png)

6. So, now you have verified that the firewall network rule is working, as you have connected a remote desktop from one server to another server located in another virtual network.

7. Close both RDP sessions to disconnect them.


## Task 10: Clean up resources 

>**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'fw-manager-rg' -Force -AsJob
   ```

    >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
